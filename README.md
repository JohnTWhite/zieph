 [Zipf's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zipf%27s_law) is an awesome principle in mathematics. Zipf observed that we, humans, will use words to an observable degree. And always, the most used word will be the word "the". Zipf's law predicts that each successive word to the word "the" will be used the inverse of it's rank to the most often used word, which again should alway's be the word "the". 
 
 So if the word "fancy" was the fifth most used word, it would be used 1/5 as often as the word "the". 
 
 Now ultimately I was attracted to this law by sheer skepticism. How, I asked myself, how could something so artistically driven be something entirely predictable to a mathematical certainty. Because Zipf's law is exactly that, a law. Not a conjecture, or a theory, it is observable fact. 
 
 Or at least that is the claim of Zipf, and every scientist, mathematician, to look upon his paper. But it is our duty, I feel, to maintain a healthy skepticism, and to put law's to the test. And that is what this project accomplishes. It test's that mathematical principle. In [this video]() I demonstrate this program's use. 
 
 I should hope you have some amount of fun exploring this fun demonstration of an interesting mathematical principle. 
 
 This program accepts a user's text written directly, or files on the user's computer, or the user can query a database that holds this information. The program counts the words in however the user chooses to input the words and outputs that into a JTable. 
 
 Each word is a row with a value of how often it is used, and how often it was predicted to be used in relation to it's rank and the most used word from the user inputed text. This predicted amount is referred to as the Zipf estimate. 
 
 Once the JTable is populated the user can either graph the information, or submit it to the database to be stored as a table named with the title supplied by the user.
