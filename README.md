 [Zipf's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zipf%27s_law) is an awesome principle in mathmatics. Zipf observed that we, humans, will use words to an observable degree. And always, the most used word will be the word "the". Zipf's law predicts that each sucsesive word to the word "the" will be used the inverse of it's rank to the word "the", or the most often used word to be more precise. 
 
 So if the word "fancy" was the fifth most used word, it would be used 1/5 as much as the word "the". 
 
 Now ultimately I was attracted to this law by sheer skeptsisim. How, I asked myself, how could something so artistically driven be something entirely predictable to a mathmatical certainty. Because Zipf's law is exactly that, a law. Not a conjecture, or a theory, it is observable fact. 
 
 Or at least that is the claim of Zipf, and every scientist, mathmatician, to look upon his paper. But it is our duty, I feel, to maintain a healthy skeptisim, and to put law's to the test. And that is what this project accomplishes. It test's that mathmatical principle. In [this video]() I demonstrate this program's use. 
 
 I should hope you have some amount of fun exploring this awesome demonstration of an interesting mathmatical principle.
